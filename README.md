This command will help to get the mirror of **pku** practice experiment. Tools are already there.

```bash
docker pull maxxing/compiler-dev
```

And this helps to 'move' your local project into the test environment.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /home/your_path:/root/compiler maxxing/compiler-dev bash
```
If wanna exit, just type `exit` or `Ctrl+D`. 
```bash
# How to test?
make
build/compiler -koopa test/hello.c -o test/hello.koopa
autotest -koopa -s lv1 /root/compiler
```
